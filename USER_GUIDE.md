### Performance Tips

- Generate multiple items at once for variety
- Experiment with different genre/mood combinations
- Use the evolution statistics to track your creative journey
- Download your favorites before generating new batches

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version: Python 3.7+ required
- Verify port 5000 is not in use

### Generated files not appearing
- Check the `output/` directory exists
- Verify write permissions in the application directory
- Look for error messages in the terminal

### Slow generation
- Generating multiple items takes longer
- Large batches (10 items) may take 30+ seconds
- Album art generation is the most time-intensive

## API Endpoints
