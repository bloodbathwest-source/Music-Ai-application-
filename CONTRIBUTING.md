# Contributing to Music AI Application

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Music AI Application! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bloodbathwest-source/Music-Ai-application-.git
cd Music-Ai-application-

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

## Project Structure

- **Backend (Python)**
  - `app.py` - Main Flask application and API routes
  - `*_generator.py` - Content generation modules
  - `evolution_engine.py` - AI learning system

- **Frontend (Web)**
  - `templates/` - HTML templates
  - `static/` - CSS and JavaScript files

- **Configuration**
  - `config.json` - Application configuration
  - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Generator

1. Create a new file: `your_generator.py`
2. Implement a class with a `generate(customization)` method
3. Import and instantiate in `app.py`
4. Add corresponding UI elements in `templates/index.html`
5. Update API endpoint in `app.py` to handle new content type

Example:
```python
class YourGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize your generator
        pass
    
    def generate(self, customization):
        # Generate content based on customization
        # Return filename or content
        return "generated_file.ext"
```

### Adding New Customization Options

1. Update `config.json` with new options
2. Add to the appropriate generator's logic
3. Update UI in `templates/index.html`
4. Update `static/js/app.js` if needed

### Extending the Evolution Engine

1. Modify `evolution_engine.py`
2. Add new tracking metrics
3. Update `get_stats()` method
4. Update UI to display new metrics

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to classes and functions
- Comment complex logic

Example:
```python
def generate_content(customization):
    """
    Generate content based on user customization.
    
    Args:
        customization (dict): User's customization preferences
        
    Returns:
        str: Path to generated file
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Test your changes locally
2. Run the test script: `python test_app.py`
3. Ensure the web interface works correctly
4. Test with different customization options

## Submitting Changes

1. Commit your changes with clear commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of feature"
   ```

2. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - What the changes do
   - Why the changes are needed
   - Any relevant issue numbers

## Pull Request Guidelines
